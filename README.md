# port-tools

`port-tools` is a proposed local development control plane for discovering forgotten web servers, understanding which project owns them, assigning stable `*.localhost` URLs, and stopping them safely.

The project is currently in discovery and technical-spike stage. Product scope and acceptance criteria live in:

- [`docs/PRD-v0.1.md`](docs/PRD-v0.1.md)
- [`docs/technical-spike.md`](docs/technical-spike.md)

No privileged helper, trusted certificate authority, background service, or process termination behavior should be introduced until the corresponding decision gate in the PRD is resolved.
